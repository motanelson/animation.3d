🎬 Animation.3D

A simple 3D animation template in Python


---

🧩 Project Summary

Animation.3D is a Python project intended to create basic 3D animations, serving as a foundation for visual experimentation with spatial transformations and motion.
It provides minimal scaffolding to help students and developers understand how three-dimensional motion can be generated programmatically.

---

🎯 Purpose

The goal of Animation.3D is to act as an educational bridge between the world of animation / visual motion and programming logic.
It’s meant to help learners explore:

How to model motion in 3D space;

How to manipulate coordinates over time;

How animations are built via code rather than via visual tools.



---

👨‍🏫 Target Audience

Students of mathematics, computer graphics or animation;

Developers who want to learn 3D motion from first principles;

Educators looking for simple code-based demonstrations of animation concepts.



---

💡 Educational Vision

This project is driven by the belief that seeing motion emerge 

Using code makes abstract concepts (like vectors, transformations, and interpolations) more understandable. By combining mathematics and visualization, users can experience how small variations in coordinates create movement in 3D space.

⚙️ Installation and Usage

Requirements

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed.

1. Clone repository

git clone https://github.com/motanelson/animation.3d.git
cd animation.3d

2. (Optional) Install dependencies

If there’s a requirements.txt, you can run:

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the animation

python 2dani.py

You may find data files like out.xyt or saida.xytb — these can represent intermediate frames or animation states. Adjust or visualize them as needed.
